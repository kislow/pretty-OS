# Conky - Real time system info for your Linux desktop

Conky is a graphical tool for Linux that displays system information to your screen in real time.

## Motivation

One can use conky-manager to tweak system info, however I prefer a light weight solution without having to install a bunch of dependencies.
Hence, I have installed conky and tweaked the .conkyrc file.
